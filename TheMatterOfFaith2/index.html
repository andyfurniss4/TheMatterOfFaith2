            <p>A compelling and provocative new novel about a future where religion has died out.</p>
            <p><i>Or has it?</i></p>

            <p>Toby has grown up in a world where religion is obsolete. The only thing they worship is technology, and the nearest thing they have to a god is science.</p>
            <p>But now he’s being torn away from everything he knows and forced by his uncle onto a secret government mission to make contact with an isolated group of people who still Believe.</p>
            <p>Maria is a Believer living under the rule of her enigmatic leader, the Mastor, and having to make a decision that will change her life forever. But as her and Toby meet, they discover that there is much to learn in the other. Together they find themselves fighting in a war in which they can never be sure whose side they are on.</p>
            <p>The concepts of god and good, religion and reality collide to ensure that nothing will ever be the same again.</p>

            <h2>About the book</h2>
            <p>Eternally interested in religion and its power to move and change people, to alienate and mobilise humans, and to always, always, cause in equal parts joy and suffering, <i>The Matter of Faith</i> explores these themes through the eyes of two young innocents as they come to know the power of the people around them, of their faith and their beliefs and, above all, of themselves.</p>
            <p>Over five years in the making, it is the first in a trilogy.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="author">
